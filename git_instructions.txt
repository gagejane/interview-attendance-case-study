Fork it and send link to colleagues
Other people fork my repo.

make a branch where you have forked
get to work!

when finished:
push your work to your branch: git push origin <branch name>
after everyone else has pushed their work to git:
git checkout <partner1 branch>
git branch (just check you're on the partner's branch)
git checkout master
git merge <partner1 branch>
git checkout <partner2 branch>
git branch (to check you're on partner2)
git checkout master
git merge <partner2 branch>
git checkout <partner3 branch>
git checkout master
git merge <partner3>
git checkout <self branch>
git checkout master
git merge <self branch>

ls (is everything there??)
